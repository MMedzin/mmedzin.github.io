Recently I have done review of my wardrobe and found a bunch of clothes that I do not wear any more. They were still in good condition, so I decided to donate them to the charity. I've searched for the charity boxes in my city and found a pdf file with a table listing all clothing donation boxes in my voivodeship. Those were a lot of boxes (over two thousands), and there were just city and street addresses of them. I wanted to find one closest to my place, but definitely did not want to look up each address individually. Threrefore, I've decided to make a small script, that will parse this pdf table into pandas, query map coordinates for the addresses, and display them on a map. Here is a quick tutorial, how I've done it.

> :mortar_board: **What you'll learn below?**
> * How to parse table from pdf document into a pandas dataframe.
> * How to query geo coordinates for the address string in Python.
> * How to display locations on a map in Python.

Libraries you'll need: `camelot`, `geopandas`, `pandas`, `geopy`, `keplergl`.

If you want to follow this tutorial with the same pdf doucment, you can get the table from [here](https://pck.pl/tekstylia/files/pojemniki-wielkopolskie.pdf) or simply run:
```bash
wget https://pck.pl/tekstylia/files/pojemniki-wielkopolskie.pdf
```

Let's import libraries we'll need and begin.
